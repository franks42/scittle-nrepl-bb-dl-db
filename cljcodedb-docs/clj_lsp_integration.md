# clojure-lsp Integration with Database-Native Clojure Development

## Overview

Integrating clojure-lsp with the clj-code-db would make tremendous sense and could provide significant benefits! This document outlines how clojure-lsp's static analysis capabilities can be combined with database-native code storage for enhanced development experience.

## Complementary Strengths

### clojure-lsp's Static Analysis Capabilities
- **Symbol resolution** across entire project
- **Go-to-definition** and find references
- **Autocomplete** with context-aware suggestions
- **Semantic highlighting** and syntax awareness
- **Refactoring operations** (rename, extract function, etc.)
- **Real-time diagnostics** via clj-kondo integration

### clj-code-db's Database-Native Benefits
- **Statement-level granularity** for precise editing
- **Rich metadata storage** (purity, complexity, dependencies)
- **Query-based code analysis** 
- **AI integration context**
- **Form-level structural editing**

## Integration Architecture

### Two-Way Data Flow
```clojure
;; clojure-lsp feeds analysis data to database
(defn sync-lsp-analysis-to-db [analysis-data]
  (d/transact! code-db
    (for [symbol (:symbols analysis-data)]
      {:form/fqn (:name symbol)
       :form/type (:kind symbol)
       :form/location (:range symbol)
       :form/references (:references symbol)
       :form/documentation (:docstring symbol)
       :lsp/definition-uri (:definition-uri symbol)
       :lsp/usages (:usages symbol)})))

;; Database feeds structured data back to clojure-lsp
(defn provide-db-context-to-lsp [file-uri position]
  (let [form (find-form-at-position file-uri position)]
    {:enhanced-context
     {:purity-info (:form/pure? form)
      :complexity-score (:form/complexity-score form)
      :ai-suggestions (:form/ai-suggestions form)
      :dependency-graph (get-dependency-chain form)
      :similar-patterns (find-similar-functions form)}}))
```

### Enhanced LSP Features

#### 1. **Supercharged Autocomplete**
```clojure
;; Traditional clojure-lsp autocomplete
["map" "filter" "reduce"]

;; Database-enhanced autocomplete with context
[{:symbol "my.app.users/validate-user"
  :type :function
  :purity :pure
  :complexity 3
  :documentation "Validates user data structure"
  :usage-examples ["(validate-user {:email \"test@example.com\"})"]}
 {:symbol "my.app.users/process-user" 
  :type :function
  :purity :impure
  :complexity 8
  :warning "Complex function - consider decomposition"
  :dependencies ["my.app.db/save-user" "my.app.email/send-welcome"]}]
```

#### 2. **Context-Aware Documentation**
```clojure
;; Hover over function shows enhanced info
{:standard-info "Function: validate-user [user] -> boolean"
 :enhanced-info 
 {:purity "Pure function - no side effects"
  :complexity "Low complexity (score: 3)"
  :dependencies ["clojure.core/and" "clojure.core/map?"]
  :usage-patterns ["Input validation" "Data pipeline filtering"]
  :performance "Fast - O(1) complexity"
  :test-coverage "95% covered (12 test cases)"
  :ai-insights "Well-designed validation function following best practices"}}
```

#### 3. **Intelligent Refactoring**
```clojure
;; clojure-lsp suggests refactoring
;; Database provides impact analysis
(defn enhanced-rename-analysis [old-fqn new-fqn]
  {:lsp-analysis (get-standard-rename-analysis old-fqn new-fqn)
   :db-analysis 
   {:affected-forms (find-all-references old-fqn)
    :complexity-impact (analyze-complexity-change old-fqn new-fqn)
    :breaking-changes (find-breaking-changes old-fqn new-fqn)
    :suggested-tests (find-tests-to-update old-fqn)
    :ai-review "Rename appears safe - no semantic conflicts detected"}})
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Read-Only Integration
```clojure
;; clojure-lsp analyzes code, populates database
(defn lsp-to-db-sync []
  "Import clojure-lsp analysis results into database"
  (let [workspace-symbols (lsp/get-workspace-symbols)
        references (lsp/get-all-references)
        diagnostics (lsp/get-diagnostics)]
    (populate-database-from-lsp-analysis workspace-symbols references diagnostics)))
```

### Phase 2: Bidirectional Enhancement
```clojure
;; Database enhances LSP responses
(defn enhance-lsp-completion [completion-items file-uri position]
  (map (fn [item]
         (let [db-info (get-symbol-metadata (:label item))]
           (merge item {:enhanced-documentation (:documentation db-info)
                       :purity-info (:purity db-info)
                       :complexity-warning (:complexity-warning db-info)
                       :usage-examples (:examples db-info)})))
       completion-items))
```

### Phase 3: Database-First Features
```clojure
;; New LSP commands powered by database queries
(def db-enhanced-commands
  {"clojure-lsp.find-by-complexity" find-high-complexity-functions
   "clojure-lsp.find-pure-functions" find-pure-functions-in-namespace
   "clojure-lsp.suggest-decomposition" suggest-function-decomposition
   "clojure-lsp.find-similar-patterns" find-similar-code-patterns
   "clojure-lsp.optimize-imports" optimize-fqn-usage})
```

## Enhanced Development Experience

### Intelligent Suggestions
```clojure
;; LSP shows suggestions enhanced by database analysis
{:position {:line 42 :character 15}
 :suggestions
 [{:type :performance
   :message "Function has high complexity (score: 23) - consider decomposition"
   :actions ["Extract sub-functions" "View complexity analysis" "See similar patterns"]}
  {:type :purity  
   :message "Function calls impure operations - mark as side-effectful"
   :actions ["Add purity metadata" "Review side effects" "Suggest pure alternatives"]}
  {:type :ai-insight
   :message "AI suggests: This function could benefit from error handling"
   :actions ["Add try-catch" "Generate error tests" "Review error patterns"]}]}
```

### Database-Powered Code Actions
```clojure
;; New code actions only possible with database
["Extract to pure function (based on purity analysis)"
 "Split complex function (based on complexity score)"
 "Find similar implementations (based on pattern matching)"
 "Generate comprehensive tests (based on usage analysis)"
 "Optimize performance (based on profiling data)"
 "Add appropriate logging (based on function characteristics)"]
```

## Benefits of Integration

### ✅ **Best of Both Worlds**
- LSP's real-time analysis + Database's rich metadata
- Standard LSP features + Database-native queries
- File-based compatibility + Statement-level precision

### ✅ **Enhanced Developer Experience**
- **Richer autocomplete** with context and examples
- **Smarter refactoring** with impact analysis
- **Intelligent suggestions** based on code patterns
- **Performance insights** integrated into editor

### ✅ **Seamless Editor Integration**
- Works with existing LSP clients (VS Code, Emacs, Vim, etc.)
- No changes needed to editor configurations
- Enhanced features appear automatically
- Backward compatible with standard clojure-lsp

### ✅ **AI-Enhanced Development**
- LSP provides real-time context to AI
- Database provides historical patterns and analysis
- AI suggestions integrated into standard LSP workflow
- Contextual AI assistance during coding

## Implementation Considerations

### Database Synchronization
```clojure
;; Keep database in sync with file changes
(defn sync-file-changes [file-uri changes]
  (let [updated-forms (parse-file-to-forms file-uri)]
    (d/transact! code-db
      (update-forms-for-file file-uri updated-forms))
    ;; Notify clojure-lsp of changes
    (lsp/notify-file-changed file-uri changes)))
```

### Performance Optimization
- **Incremental updates** to avoid full re-analysis
- **Caching** of expensive database queries
- **Lazy loading** of detailed metadata
- **Background processing** for heavy analysis

## Conclusion

This integration would create a powerful development environment that combines clojure-lsp's proven static analysis capabilities with the database-native approach's rich metadata and AI integration potential. The result would be an enhanced Clojure development experience that maintains compatibility with existing tooling while providing advanced features only possible through database-native code storage.
