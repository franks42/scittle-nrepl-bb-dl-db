# Database-Native Logging: Query-Driven Log Management

## Overview

When code is stored in a database rather than scattered across files, logging becomes a **data problem** rather than a **search problem**. This document explores how database-native code storage enables sophisticated, automated logging strategies that would be impractical with traditional file-based development.

## The Fundamental Shift

### Traditional File-Based Logging Challenges

```bash
# Manual hunting for logging opportunities
grep -r "try\|catch" src/          # Find error handling
grep -r "payment\|transaction" src/ # Find sensitive operations  
grep -r "external\|api" src/       # Find integration points

# Result: Inconsistent logging, missed opportunities, manual maintenance
```

**Problems**:
- **Manual Discovery**: Developers must manually identify where logging is needed
- **Inconsistent Coverage**: Some critical paths lack logging while others are over-logged
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Adding/removing logging requires editing many files
- **Context Gaps**: Hard to ensure consistent context across related functions

### Database-Native Logging Advantages

```clojure
;; Query-based discovery of logging opportunities
(d/q '[:find ?fqn ?complexity
       :where
       [?e :form/fqn ?fqn]
       [?e :form/complexity-score ?complexity]
       [(> ?complexity 15)]]
     @code-db)

;; Result: Systematic, complete, automated logging management
```

**Benefits**:
- **Query-Based Discovery**: Find optimal logging locations using database queries
- **Automated Application**: Apply logging policies consistently across entire codebase
- **Contextual Intelligence**: Extract relevant business context automatically
- **Centralized Management**: Update logging strategies from single location

## Query-Based Log Point Discovery

### 1. **Find Functions Needing Error Logging**

```clojure
;; Functions with exception handling (need error logging)
(d/q '[:find ?fqn ?source
       :where
       [?e :form/fqn ?fqn]
       [?e :form/source ?source]
       [(clojure.string/includes? ?source "try")]
       [(clojure.string/includes? ?source "catch")]]
     @code-db)

;; Functions calling external APIs (likely to fail)
(d/q '[:find ?fqn
       :where
       [?e :form/fqn ?fqn]
       [?e :form/dependencies ?dep]
       [(clojure.string/includes? ?dep "http")]
       [(clojure.string/includes? ?dep "client")]]
     @code-db)
```

### 2. **Identify Performance Monitoring Candidates**

```clojure
;; High-complexity functions (performance logging candidates)
(d/q '[:find ?fqn ?complexity
       :where
       [?e :form/fqn ?fqn]
       [?e :form/complexity-score ?complexity]
       [(> ?complexity 15)]]
     @code-db)

;; Functions with expensive operations
(d/q '[:find ?fqn
       :where
       [?e :form/fqn ?fqn]
       [?e :form/source ?source]
       [(clojure.string/includes? ?source "reduce")]
       [(clojure.string/includes? ?source "database")]
       [(clojure.string/includes? ?source "external")]]
     @code-db)
```

### 3. **Discover Audit Logging Requirements**

```clojure
;; Functions processing sensitive data (audit logging required)
(d/q '[:find ?fqn
       :where
       [?e :form/fqn ?fqn]
       [?e :form/source ?source]
       [(clojure.string/includes? ?source "email")]
       [(clojure.string/includes? ?source "password")]
       [(clojure.string/includes? ?source "payment")]
       [(clojure.string/includes? ?source "ssn")]]
     @code-db)

;; Functions in compliance-sensitive namespaces
(d/q '[:find ?fqn
       :where
       [?e :form/fqn ?fqn]
       [?e :form/namespace ?ns]
       [(clojure.string/includes? ?ns "payments")]
       [(clojure.string/includes? ?ns "auth")]
       [(clojure.string/includes? ?ns "security")]]
     @code-db)
```

### 4. **Find Over-Logged Areas**

```clojure
;; Pure utility functions (minimal logging needed)
(d/q '[:find ?fqn
       :where
       [?e :form/fqn ?fqn]
       [?e :form/pure? true]
       [?e :form/complexity-score ?complexity]
       [(< ?complexity 5)]]
     @code-db)

;; Functions with existing logging (avoid duplication)
(d/q '[:find ?fqn
       :where
       [?e :form/fqn ?fqn]
       [?e :form/source ?source]
       [(clojure.string/includes? ?source "log")]
       [(clojure.string/includes? ?source "logger")]]
     @code-db)
```

## Automated Log Point Injection

### 1. **Entrance/Exit Logging for Critical Functions**

```clojure
(defn add-payment-logging []
  "Add comprehensive logging to all payment processing functions"
  (let [payment-functions (d/q '[:find ?fqn ?source
                                :where
                                [?e :form/fqn ?fqn]
                                [?e :form/namespace "my.app.payments"]
                                [?e :form/source ?source]]
                              @code-db)]
    (d/transact! code-db
      (for [[fqn source] payment-functions]
        [:db/add [:form/fqn fqn] :form/source 
         (wrap-with-logging source fqn)]))))

(defn wrap-with-logging [source fqn]
  "Transform function to include entry/exit/error logging"
  (let [parsed (read-string source)
        [def-symbol fn-name params & body] parsed]
    (pr-str
      `(~def-symbol ~fn-name ~params
         (my.app.logging/log-entry ~(str fqn) ~params)
         (try
           (let [result# (do ~@body)]
             (my.app.logging/log-exit ~(str fqn) result#)
             result#)
           (catch Exception e#
             (my.app.logging/log-error ~(str fqn) e# ~params)
             (throw e#)))))))
```

### 2. **Contextual Log Level Assignment**

```clojure
(defn assign-intelligent-log-levels []
  "Automatically assign appropriate log levels based on function characteristics"
  (d/transact! code-db
    (concat
      ;; Critical functions get DEBUG level logging
      (for [fqn (find-critical-functions)]
        [:db/add [:form/fqn fqn] :form/log-level :debug])
      
      ;; External integrations get INFO level
      (for [fqn (find-external-integration-functions)]
        [:db/add [:form/fqn fqn] :form/log-level :info])
      
      ;; Error handlers get WARN level  
      (for [fqn (find-error-handling-functions)]
        [:db/add [:form/fqn fqn] :form/log-level :warn])
      
      ;; Pure utility functions get TRACE level
      (for [fqn (find-pure-utility-functions)]
        [:db/add [:form/fqn fqn] :form/log-level :trace]))))

(defn find-critical-functions []
  (d/q '[:find [?fqn ...]
         :where
         [?e :form/fqn ?fqn]
         [?e :form/dependencies ?dep]
         [(clojure.string/includes? ?dep "payment")]
         [(clojure.string/includes? ?dep "security")]
         [(clojure.string/includes? ?dep "auth")]]
       @code-db))
```

### 3. **Smart Context Extraction**

```clojure
(defn add-contextual-logging [fqn]
  "Add logging with automatically extracted business context"
  (let [form (get-form fqn)
        params (extract-parameters form)
        context-fields (determine-log-context params)]
    (wrap-with-contextual-logging form context-fields)))

(defn determine-log-context [params]
  "Intelligently determine what context to include in logs"
  (for [param params]
    (cond
      (= param 'user) {:field :user-id :extractor "(:id user)"}
      (= param 'order) {:field :order-id :extractor "(:id order)"}
      (= param 'request) {:field :request-id :extractor "(:request-id request)"}
      (= param 'payment) {:field :payment-method :extractor "(:method payment)"}
      :else {:field param :extractor (str param)})))

;; Generated result includes relevant business context
(defn my.app.orders/process-order [order user]
  (my.app.logging/log-entry "process-order" 
                           {:order-id (:id order)
                            :user-id (:id user)
                            :correlation-id (my.app.context/get-correlation-id)
                            :timestamp (java.time.Instant/now)})
  ;; ... original function body ...
  )
```

## Advanced Logging Strategies

### 1. **Performance Monitoring Integration**

```clojure
(defn add-performance-monitoring []
  "Add performance monitoring to computationally expensive functions"
  (let [expensive-functions (d/q '[:find ?fqn
                                  :where
                                  [?e :form/fqn ?fqn]
                                  [?e :form/complexity-score ?complexity]
                                  [(> ?complexity 20)]]
                                @code-db)]
    (doseq [fqn expensive-functions]
      (update-form fqn
        (wrap-with-performance-monitoring (get-form-source fqn) fqn)))))

(defn wrap-with-performance-monitoring [source fqn]
  "Add timing and memory usage tracking"
  (let [parsed (read-string source)
        [def-symbol fn-name params & body] parsed]
    (pr-str
      `(~def-symbol ~fn-name ~params
         (my.app.monitoring/with-metrics ~(str fqn)
           (let [start-time# (System/nanoTime)
                 start-memory# (my.app.monitoring/current-memory-usage)]
             (try
               (let [result# (do ~@body)
                     duration# (/ (- (System/nanoTime) start-time#) 1000000.0)
                     memory-used# (- (my.app.monitoring/current-memory-usage) start-memory#)]
                 (my.app.monitoring/record-performance 
                   {:function ~(str fqn)
                    :duration-ms duration#
                    :memory-bytes memory-used#
                    :success true})
                 result#)
               (catch Exception e#
                 (my.app.monitoring/record-performance
                   {:function ~(str fqn)
                    :duration-ms (/ (- (System/nanoTime) start-time#) 1000000.0)
                    :success false
                    :error (.getMessage e#)})
                 (throw e#)))))))))
```

### 2. **Compliance and Audit Logging**

```clojure
(defn add-compliance-logging []
  "Add detailed audit logging for functions processing sensitive data"
  (let [sensitive-functions (find-sensitive-data-functions)]
    (doseq [fqn sensitive-functions]
      (update-form fqn
        (wrap-with-audit-logging (get-form-source fqn) fqn)))))

(defn wrap-with-audit-logging [source fqn]
  "Add comprehensive audit trail for sensitive operations"
  (let [parsed (read-string source)
        [def-symbol fn-name params & body] parsed]
    (pr-str
      `(~def-symbol ~fn-name ~params
         (my.app.audit/log-sensitive-operation 
           {:function ~(str fqn)
            :user (my.app.context/current-user-id)
            :timestamp (java.time.Instant/now)
            :params (my.app.audit/sanitize-params ~params)
            :request-id (my.app.context/request-id)})
         (try
           (let [result# (do ~@body)]
             (my.app.audit/log-sensitive-result 
               {:function ~(str fqn) 
                :success true
                :result-summary (my.app.audit/summarize-result result#)})
             result#)
           (catch Exception e#
             (my.app.audit/log-sensitive-error 
               {:function ~(str fqn) 
                :error (.getMessage e#)
                :stack-trace (my.app.audit/safe-stack-trace e#)})
             (throw e#)))))))
```

### 3. **Intelligent Log Filtering**

```clojure
(defn apply-smart-log-filtering []
  "Apply different logging strategies based on function characteristics"
  (let [functions (get-all-functions)]
    (doseq [fqn functions]
      (let [characteristics (analyze-function-characteristics fqn)]
        (case (:logging-strategy characteristics)
          :full-logging (add-comprehensive-logging fqn)
          :error-only (add-error-logging-only fqn)
          :performance (add-performance-logging-only fqn)
          :audit (add-audit-logging-only fqn)
          :minimal (add-minimal-logging fqn)
          :none (remove-existing-logging fqn))))))

(defn analyze-function-characteristics [fqn]
  (let [form (get-form fqn)
        complexity (:form/complexity-score form)
        pure? (:form/pure? form)
        namespace (:form/namespace form)
        dependencies (:form/dependencies form)]
    
    (cond
      ;; High-value functions get full logging
      (and (> complexity 15) 
           (some #(contains-sensitive-terms? %) dependencies))
      {:logging-strategy :full-logging}
      
      ;; Pure utility functions get minimal logging
      (and pure? (< complexity 5))
      {:logging-strategy :minimal}
      
      ;; Error-prone functions get error-focused logging
      (contains-external-calls? dependencies)
      {:logging-strategy :error-only}
      
      ;; Performance-critical functions get timing logs
      (> complexity 20)
      {:logging-strategy :performance}
      
      ;; Compliance-sensitive functions get audit logs
      (compliance-namespace? namespace)
      {:logging-strategy :audit}
      
      :else
      {:logging-strategy :none})))
```

## Enhanced Database Schema

```clojure
(def logging-enhanced-schema
  {:form/fqn {:db/unique :db.unique/identity}
   :form/source {}
   :form/namespace {}
   :form/complexity-score {}

```

### Example AI Logging Session

```
User: "Can you add appropriate logging to our payment processing system?"

AI: I'll analyze your payment functions and add contextual logging based on their 
characteristics and risk profiles.

[Analyzes database for payment-related functions]

Found 12 payment functions across 3 namespaces:
- my.app.payments: 8 functions (core payment processing)
- my.app.billing: 3 functions (billing calculations) 
- my.app.fraud: 1 function (fraud detection)

Analysis results:
- 6 functions need audit logging (handle sensitive financial data)
- 4 functions need performance monitoring (complex calculations/external calls)
- 8 functions need error logging (external API interactions)
- 2 functions need minimal logging (pure utility functions)

Applying intelligent logging strategies:
✅ process-payment: INFO level + audit trail + performance monitoring
✅ validate-card-number: WARN level + security logging (PII masked)
✅ call-stripe-api: ERROR level + retry tracking + latency monitoring  
✅ calculate-tax: DEBUG level + calculation trace
✅ format-amount: TRACE level + sampling (0.1% of calls)

Generated 23 new log points with contextual information:
- User/order/transaction IDs for correlation
- Sanitized request/response summaries  
- Performance metrics for optimization
- Compliance audit trails for regulations

Estimated logging overhead: 1.8% CPU increase

Would you like me to:
1. Apply these logging changes to the database
2. Generate a logging coverage report
3. Set up log monitoring dashboards
4. Add similar analysis to related modules
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Analysis and Discovery
1. **Query existing codebase** for logging opportunities using database queries
2. **Classify functions** by logging requirements (audit, performance, error, minimal)
3. **Generate logging strategy report** with AI assistance

### Phase 2: Automated Application
1. **Apply logging transformations** to functions based on classification
2. **Generate wrapped source code** with appropriate logging context
3. **Update database** with logging metadata and enhanced source

### Phase 3: Monitoring and Optimization
1. **Analyze logging performance impact** in production
2. **Adjust sampling rates** and log levels based on actual usage
3. **Iterate on logging strategies** based on operational feedback

## Conclusion

Database-native code storage transforms logging from a **manual search-and-modify process** into a **data-driven optimization problem**. By treating code as queryable data, we can:

- **Systematically identify** optimal logging locations
- **Automatically apply** consistent logging policies  
- **Intelligently extract** relevant business context
- **Centrally manage** logging strategies across entire codebases

This approach ensures **comprehensive logging coverage** while **minimizing overhead** and **maintaining consistency** - capabilities that are difficult or impossible to achieve with traditional file-based development.

The result is **better observability** with **less manual effort** and **fewer gaps** in critical monitoring coverage.
