**TerminusDB** implements an RDF-based property graph with git-like versioning, achieving **81% more compact storage than Neo4j**. Its immutable delta encoding with succinct data structures enables efficient branching and merging operations. The JSON Schema interface (replacing OWL in v10.0) provides flexible schema design with constraints ideal for evolving AST structures.

**CozoDB** supports multiple storage backends (RocksDB, SQLite, memory) with optional time-travel capabilities per relation. Its transactional consistency combined with built-in vector database capabilities using HNSW indices makes it suitable for both traditional queries and semantic code analysis. The system's graph algorithms are optimized for dependency analysis and code relationship queries.

**Souffle**, designed for batch analysis, uses specialized templated data structures that scale to billions of tuples. While primarily in-memory, it supports memory-mapped files for large datasets and provides multiple I/O formats including SQLite3 integration. The parallel C++ code generation enables multi-core execution essential for large-scale code analysis.

## Deployment complexity and integration options

Deployment requirements vary dramatically across solutions. **DataScript** offers the simplest deployment as a **32KB in-memory library** suitable for browser-based code analysis tools. It requires no installation beyond adding a dependency and works seamlessly in Clojure, ClojureScript, and JavaScript environments. However, its in-memory nature limits it to smaller codebases.

**Datalevin** provides flexible deployment through a single JVM library, command-line tools (dtlv), native binaries, and Docker images. Its GraalVM native image support and Babashka Pod integration enable rapid scripting scenarios. The client/server mode supports team-based analysis while maintaining low resource requirements.

**XTDB** deploys via Docker containers with Postgres wire compatibility, simplifying integration with existing tools. As a JVM-based system with Clojure API, it requires more resources but provides enterprise features including distributed deployment options. The active development by JUXT ensures ongoing support and improvements.

**CozoDB** achieves remarkable deployment flexibility as a Rust implementation that runs on mobile devices, web browsers, and servers. Its single executable deployment with embeddable support for multiple languages makes it suitable for diverse environments. The system's ability to run efficiently on resource-constrained devices opens unique possibilities for edge-based code analysis.

**TerminusDB** primarily deploys through Docker containers with REST API and GraphQL endpoints. While requiring more infrastructure (recommend >2GB RAM for Windows Docker), it provides comprehensive client libraries for Python, JavaScript, and Node.js. The Apache 2.0 license ensures complete open-source availability.

**Souffle** requires C++ compilation for production use but provides pre-compiled packages for major Linux distributions. Its dual-mode operation (interpreted and compiled) allows rapid prototyping followed by compilation for production performance. The command-line interface with comprehensive options supports integration into existing build pipelines.

## Specialized features for code analysis workloads

Several databases offer features specifically valuable for code storage and analysis. **XTDB's bitemporal capabilities** enable tracking when code changes occurred (system-time) versus when they were logically valid (valid-time), crucial for understanding code evolution and debugging temporal issues. This dual-time approach supports compliance requirements and sophisticated audit trails.

**Glean**, developed by Meta, is purpose-built for code analysis with its Angle query language optimized for code structure queries. It supports multi-language indexing with type-safe schemas and DAG-structured facts. While complex to deploy, it represents production-proven technology handling Meta's massive codebases with strong IDE integration capabilities.

**Souffle's** design specifically targets static program analysis, with widespread use in pointer analysis (Doop framework), taint analysis, and binary disassembly (DDISASM). Oracle Labs uses it for Java security analysis in OpenJDK. Its component model enables reusable analysis libraries, while record types naturally represent AST nodes with type safety for different node types.

**Datalevin's** native full-text search engine, competitive with Lucene, enables code search across entire codebases with Boolean expressions and phrase search. Combined with SIMD-accelerated vector indexing, it supports semantic code analysis and machine learning integration for code embeddings, opening possibilities for AI-powered code understanding.

**TerminusDB's** git-like versioning with branching and merging operations mirrors developer workflows. The JSON-LD format facilitates integration with development tools, while the compact storage and efficient delta encoding make it practical for tracking large codebases over time.
